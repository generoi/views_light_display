WARNING! This module was made when I didn't know about the Embed Display in Views. You can activate it in the Views Settings tab, and it does exactly what this module does.

Views light display
===================

Provide a light views display which supports pager but has to be included in
code or other modules. This replaces:

- Blocks displays referenced with eg viewfield that cant be attachments as they need an individual pager.
- Attachments which arent really attachments.

Installation
------------
1. Enable
2. Create a views display using the new "Light display" display.
