Views light display
===================

Provide a light views display which supports pager but has to be included in
code or other modules. This replaces:

- Blocks displays referenced with eg viewfield that cant be attachments as they need an individual pager.
- Attachments which arent really attachments.

Installation
------------
1. Enable
2. Create a views display using the new "Light display" display.
